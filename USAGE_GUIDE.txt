2. Demonstrating Memory Management Algorithms
----------------------------------------
a) Fixed Partitioning:
   Step-by-step demonstration:
   1. Click "Algorithm" dropdown → Select "Fixed Partitioning"
   2. Try these exact scenarios:
      - Perfect Fit Example:
        * Enter exactly "64" in size field
        * Click "Allocate Memory"
        * Look at memory map: One clean 64KB block appears
        * Check utilization: Should show 100% for this block

      - Internal Fragmentation Example:
        * Type "40" in size field
        * Click "Allocate Memory"
        * Observe memory map: 64KB block used
        * Look for wasted space indicator: 24KB unused
        * Check utilization: Should show ~62.5%

      - Multiple Block Example:
        * Enter and allocate in this order:
          1. Type "64" → Allocate
          2. Type "128" → Allocate
          3. Type "64" → Allocate
        * Verify memory map shows:
          - Three distinct colored blocks
          - Aligned at partition boundaries
          - No gaps between blocks

b) Dynamic Partitioning:
   Step-by-step demonstration:

          - Exactly 50KB block
          - Exactly 120KB block
          - Exactly 75KB block
          - No wasted space between

      - Fragmentation Example:

          3. Type "150" → Allocate (P3)
        * Select P2 (200KB block)
        * Click "Deallocate Memory"

        * Click "Allocate Memory"
        * Observe page table:
          - 4 page entries created
          - Each page = 64KB
          - Sequential frame numbers

      - Page Fault Creation:
        * Set physical memory limit low
        * Allocate these sizes in order:

          2. Type "128" → Allocate
          3. Type "256" → Allocate
        * Watch page fault counter increase
        * Observe page replacements in table

      - FIFO vs LRU Comparison:
        * Reset memory

          - Type = CODE

      - Data Segments:
        * Type "32" → Name "DATA" → Allocate
        * Type "16" → Name "STACK" → Allocate
        * Check segment table:

3. Performance Analysis Scenarios
----------------------------
a) Memory Utilization Test:
   1. For each algorithm, follow these steps:
      * Reset memory
      * Allocate these exact sizes:
        1. 64KB, 128KB, 32KB, 96KB
        2. 256KB, 48KB, 128KB
        3. 64KB, 32KB, 96KB
      * Record these metrics:
        - Total memory allocated
        - Actual process sizes sum
        - Fragmentation percentage

b) Fragmentation Analysis:

        1. 128KB (P1)
        2. 64KB  (P2)
        3. 256KB (P3)
        4. 96KB  (P4)
        5. 128KB (P5)
        6. 32KB  (P6)
      * Deallocate in this order:
        - P2, P4, P6
   2. Try allocating 160KB
   3. Compare results:
      - Fixed: Note internal fragments
      - Dynamic: See unusable gaps
      - Buddy: Observe power-of-2 waste

c) Page Replacement Test:
   1. Configure memory:
      * Set physical frames to 8
      * Choose FIFO algorithm
   2. Create page faults:
      * Allocate in sequence:
        1. 256KB (4 pages)
        2. 192KB (3 pages)
        3. 320KB (5 pages)
      * Record fault count
   3. Repeat with LRU:
      * Reset memory
      * Use same allocation pattern
      * Compare fault numbers

4. Tips for Effective Demonstration

5. Troubleshooting Common Issues
----------------------------
a) Allocation Failures:
   - Check available memory display
   - Look for fragmentation indicators
   - Verify algorithm limitations
   - Try these steps:
     1. Reset memory
     2. Allocate smaller sizes
     3. Use defragmentation if available

b) Performance Issues:
   - Click Reset to clear memory
   - Reduce allocation sizes by half
   - Deallocate largest processes
   - Watch memory utilization gauge
   - Monitor page fault counter

Remember: Each algorithm has specific strengths. Use these exact steps to understand when each performs best. Take notes on the behaviors you observe.
