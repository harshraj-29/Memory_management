Memory Management Simulator - Application Flow Documentation

1. System Architecture Overview
   - Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
   - Backend (Node.js/Express.js)
   - Core Logic (C++)

2. Data Flow Sequence

   a. User Interaction (Frontend)
      - User inputs memory management parameters
      - User selects memory management algorithm
      - User triggers memory allocation/deallocation requests
      - Frontend sends API requests to backend

   b. Backend Processing (Node.js)
      - Express.js server receives API requests
      - Validates and processes incoming requests
      - Communicates with C++ module via child processes
      - Handles response formatting and error handling

   c. Core Logic Processing (C++)
      - Receives memory management requests
      - Executes selected memory management algorithm
      - Processes memory allocation/deallocation
      - Generates memory state as JSON output
      - Returns results to backend

   d. Visualization Flow (Frontend)
      - Receives processed data from backend
      - Updates memory block visualization
      - Displays process queue status
      - Shows memory statistics
      - Renders algorithm performance metrics

3. Component Communication

   Frontend → Backend:
   - HTTP/API requests for memory operations
   - Algorithm selection parameters
   - Memory block size requirements
   - Process information

   Backend → C++ Module:
   - Memory management algorithm selection
   - Memory allocation requests
   - Process queue management
   - Memory state queries

   C++ Module → Backend:
   - Memory allocation results
   - Current memory state
   - Algorithm performance metrics
   - Error status and messages

   Backend → Frontend:
   - JSON formatted memory state
   - Operation success/failure status
   - Updated process queue information
   - Performance statistics

4. Memory Management Algorithms
   - First Fit
   - Best Fit
   - Worst Fit
   - Next Fit
   Each algorithm processes memory requests differently while maintaining:
   - Memory block allocation
   - Fragment management
   - Process tracking
   - Memory state consistency

5. Error Handling
   - Frontend: User input validation
   - Backend: Request validation and API error handling
   - C++ Module: Memory management error handling
   - Cross-component error propagation

6. Performance Considerations
   - Asynchronous communication
   - Efficient memory state updates
   - Optimized visualization rendering
   - Minimal data transfer overhead
